\section{Overview}
For this assignment, we performed the following tasks: getting a domain via the GitHub Student Developer Pack, getting an SSL certificate for our overleaf domain, configure Latex / Overleaf to support all packages, connecting Overleaf to Github for project version control, compiling TEX projects from the command line.

\section{Domain Name}
We decided to register the domain \texttt{ssw590f25.me} using the GitHub Student Developer Pack, which provided a free one-year domain through Namecheap. This allowed us to set up a professional web address for our project with minimal cost and effort.
