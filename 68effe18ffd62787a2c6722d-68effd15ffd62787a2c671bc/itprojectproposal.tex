\section{Figma2AWS}

\subsection*{Project Description}
\paragraph{} We aim to create a plugin tool for the Figma UI/UX design tool, which allows users to turn their designs from the Figma software into a static and simple website with HTML and JavaScript.

\subsection*{Sample Task and DevSecOps Tools}
\paragraph{} Throughout our DevSecOps processes, we plan on using GitHub for source control. We'll create a pipeline consisting in transforming the Figma design into HTML, CSS and JS code by using the \href{https://composio.dev/blog/how-to-use-figma-mcp-with-claude-code-to-build-pixel-perfect-designs}{Figma Composio MCP Server}.  
\paragraph{} Then, we will containerize the web application using Docker and deploy the Docker image to AWS by using the App Runner service. The user will obtain a default AWS domain where the website will be deployed, although they will have to provide an AWS key to use the plugin.
